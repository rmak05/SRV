# SRV
This is static website that I created using HTML and CSS.   
Samarth Ramdas Vidyalaya (SRV) is the school from which I completed my 10th standard(Secondary Education).   
This is just a basic front end website that I made to put what I learned in HTML and CSS to use.
The website currently contains has no back end but I am planning to add it in the future.
